*Source Files*

We model each kit in SolidWorks. To access the parametric source files, download the *AKER - Hexagon Planter - v1.0 - SW-P.zip* file and then establish local file references following this video: [AKER - Parametric Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ewdrlv4nSA0). You can then adjust the model dimensions using the external *Equations.txt* file.

The **Hexagon Planter** was modeled using our older modeling style, so the range of tool size to sheet thickness combinations are more limited than our 2016 kits. This source file pack has DXFs in the following formats:

 * 0.5 inch material & 0.25 inch tool
 * 0.75 inch material & 0.25 inch tool
 * 12 mm material & 6.35 mm tool
 * 18 mm material & 6.35 mm tool
